# Tic Tac Toe with Minimax Algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning

## Overview

This project is a multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game implemented using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning, for enhanced efficiency. This project is a part of an assignment of our class Algorithm Design and Analysis. The game allows multiple players to connect to a central server and play against a computer opponent which runs the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning.

## Development

The project was developed by a team of 10 individuals. The team roles were as follows:

- Thenical Project Manager
- Backend Team with Leader
- Frontend Team with Leader
- QA Member
- DevOps Member

The development process was managed using Jira, where tasks were assigned, tracked, and completed. The team collaborated to create a stable version, which underwent testing before deployment. Test details can be found in the Links and References section.

## Gameplay

1. Players input their names.
2. Choose whether the computer plays first or the player.
3. Choose the player's symbol (X or O).
4. Click Start Game.
5. Players and the computer share a private lobby (room), enabling multiple players to challenge the computer simultaneously.

## Technical Aspect

- **Framework:** Node.js with Express
- **Templating Engine:** EJS
- **Real-time Communication:** Socket.io

Node.js was chosen for its convenience in creating robust app architectures and easy deployment. Express simplifies handling HTTP requests, while EJS serves as a convenient templating engine. Socket.io facilitates seamless communication via sockets, crucial for implementing multiplayer functionality. Deployment was done using Render for its excellent Node.js deployment solutions.
